Cisco Packet Tracer topology


Scenario:
Imagine a team composed by 4 people. Each team member has a computer that needs a network connection to communicate with the others.
Use Cisco Packet Tracer to create a star network topology.
Drag a switch to the center of the workspace.
Drag four PCs and position them around the switch, representing each team member.
Connect the devices.
Connect each PC to a different port on the switch using Ethernet cables.
Visualize the production team computers forming a star around the central switch.
Configure IP addresses.
Create a sense of identity for each computer by assigning names and IP address numbers.
Configure the IP addresses for the PCs' and switch's interfaces according to the same subnet.

Test communication
To verify that all computers are correctly configured, access one of the team's PCs, open the command prompt, and try to ping the IP address of another team member's computer.
